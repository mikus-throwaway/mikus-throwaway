throwaway is kind of a harsh term. this is really just my github account for anything that i don’t particularly *care* about, or little projects and experiments that i don’t feel belong on my main account. sometimes it’s just quick tests, other times it’s stuff i never really plan to polish or maintain. if you know me, you already know where to look for the things i actually put effort into.
